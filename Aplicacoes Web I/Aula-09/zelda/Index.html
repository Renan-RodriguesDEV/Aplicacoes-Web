        <h1>Zelda: Breath of the Wild vence prêmio de Melhor jogo de 2017 no The Game Awards</h1>
        <p>O <span class="negrito"> The Game Awards </span> 2017 premiou <span class="verde"> The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </span>como o <span class="negrito">Melhor Jogo do Ano.</span> The
            Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and a watershed game that
            reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon
            dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. <span class="negrito"> I’ve had so many adventures in
            Breath of the Wild,</span> and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top
            of stories. And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage
            to come across things I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its
            fascinating moments.</p>
